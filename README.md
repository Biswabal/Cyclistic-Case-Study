# About the Case Study

Cyclistic bike-share analysis, this case study has been completed as the final capestone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The purpose of this case study is to answer the key business questions of a fictional company, Cyclistic, by following the steps of the data analysis process which has been taught in the course: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act.

Cyclistic has been offering bike-share program since 2016. The finance analyst team of “Cyclistic” has found out that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The marketing director believes that increasing the number of annual members will be the key to the growth of the company. Rather than targeting new customers the marketing director sees potential of casual riders opting for annual membership by designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

The aim is to analyze the historical bike trip data to identify trends and better understand how annual members and casual riders differ and provide top 3 recommendations to the marketing directior.
